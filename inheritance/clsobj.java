/*Java Class and Objects
Java is an object-oriented programming language. The core concept of the object-oriented approach is to break complex problems into smaller objects.

An object is any entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a bicycle is an object. It has

States: idle, first gear, etc
Behaviors: braking, accelerating, etc.
Before we learn about objects, let's first know about classes in Java.

Java Class
A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we first need to define the class.

We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.
